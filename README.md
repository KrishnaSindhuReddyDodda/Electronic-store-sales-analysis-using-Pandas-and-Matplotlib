# Electronic-store-sales-analysis-using-Pandas-and-Matplotlib

In this project we use Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer 9 business questions for electronic sales data. We start by cleaning our data like checking for NaN values, if present then drop NaN values from Dataframe or by removing rows based on a condition. Once we have cleaned our data, we will explore 9 high level business questions related to our data:
-- What was the best year for sales? How much was earned in that year?
-- Which 5 cities had the highest number of sales?
-- What products most often sold together?
-- Which top 4 products are sold the most?
-- Customers who ordered more than a product?
-- Total number of gadgets sold in all years?
-- What is the overall sales trend?
-- Which are the top 10 sub-categories by sales?
-- Which are more profitable category and sub-category?
